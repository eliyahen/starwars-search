### Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:eliyahen/starwars-search.git
cd starwars-search
npm install
```

To run it use:
```sh
npm run dev
```

I used `yarn` locally, but it should also work with `npm`.

### Notes

- The API endpoints and the categories are dynamically loaded from https://swapi.dev/api/
- I created a base component to show any kind of category and it is made easy to configure new categories. I also show the Films category in addition to People category.
- Category page loads only the first page, and there's no pagination.
- Added dark theme.

### Enjoy!
